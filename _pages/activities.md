<h2>Club Activity</h2> 

**Mogorithm** : Interested in PS, I learned about and analyzed algorithms by solving problems that appeared in competition(ICPC)s with other members

<h2> Personal Activities</h2>
<br>

**Deep learning From Scratch 1,2**
<br>
I was curious about how AI learns data and wanted to learn about the basics of deep learning.<br> So, by reading this book, I think I was able to learn the basics of NumPy, neural networks, error calculation, and basic CNN concepts with a focus on coding.<br><br><br>

<br><br>
After the Deep Learning From Scratch activity, I wanted to know how it could be used mathematically, so I decided to do this activity.<br>
I needed to have a clear understanding of linear algebra, probability, and statistics to understand this class well, so it was quite difficult.<br>
I was able to learn linear regression and Newton's method, the mathematical meaning of backpropagation, the mathematical <br>interpretation of neural networks, the mathematical interpretation of k-clustering,<br>
and the tradeoff between bias and variance, among other topics.
<br><br>
**Algorithmic Problem Solving Strategies**
<br>
After taking a data structure class and joining a club called Morgorithm, I studied this book because I was curious about in-depth<br>  information about algorithms.<br>
I was able to learn in detail about when to use algorithms in realistic situations and how to use which algorithms.

**Image Processing for Engineering and Science Specialization(Coursera)**
<br>
I am interested in computer vision, but I don't know much about it, so I am taking a course that teaches how to use matlab and computer vision.<br>
I am learning basic techniques such as image structure, image color separation, and image segmentation.<br>
